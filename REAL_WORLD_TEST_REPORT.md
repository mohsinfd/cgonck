# CardGenius API - Real World Performance Test Report

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Production URL:** https://cardgenius-batch-api.onrender.com  
**API Key:** cgapi_2025_secure_key_12345

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **API is functional and deployed successfully**  
❌ **Performance does NOT meet production requirements for batches of 200+ users**

### Key Findings

| Batch Size | Status | Duration | Throughput | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| 10 users   | ✅ SUCCESS | 26.81s | 22.4 users/min | Acceptable for small batches |
| 200 users  | ❌ TIMEOUT | 300+s | <40 users/min | Unacceptable for production |

---

## Detailed Analysis

### Performance Bottleneck

**Current Architecture:**
- Sequential API calls to CardGenius external API
- Each user requires ~2-3 seconds for API call + processing
- **No parallelization** of external API calls

**Time Breakdown for 200 users:**
```
200 users × 1.5s avg per user = 300 seconds minimum
+ Render cold start time
+ Network latency
= 5+ minutes total
```

### Production Requirements (Data Team)

Based on typical data team workflows:
- **Batch size:** 200-500 users per request
- **Target completion time:** < 2 minutes for 200 users
- **Required throughput:** ~100+ users/min
- **Current throughput:** 22.4 users/min ❌

**Gap:** We need to be **4-5x faster** to meet production needs.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Parallel Processing (RECOMMENDED)
**Implement concurrent API calls to CardGenius**

```python
# Current: Sequential
for user in users:
    result = call_cardgenius_api(user)  # ~1.5s each

# Recommended: Parallel
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20) as executor:
    results = executor.map(call_cardgenius_api, users)
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 200 users with 20 parallel workers = 200 / 20 × 1.5s = **15 seconds**
- **Throughput:** ~800 users/min (36x improvement)

**Pros:**
- Massive speed improvement
- Simple to implement
- No infrastructure changes needed

**Cons:**
- Need to verify CardGenius API rate limits
- May need to implement rate limiting/backoff

### Option 2: Increase Timeout (TEMPORARY FIX)
Accept slower processing but ensure jobs complete:
- Increase max processing time to 10-15 minutes
- Add better progress tracking
- Implement job resume capability

**Pros:**
- Quick fix, no major code changes
- Jobs will eventually complete

**Cons:**
- Still too slow for production use
- Poor user experience
- Doesn't scale

### Option 3: Batch Optimization
Request batching support from CardGenius API:
- Send multiple users in one API call
- Requires CardGenius API changes
- Best long-term solution

## Test Data Generated

We created realistic test scenarios based on CashKaro user patterns:

### Spending Distribution
- **High spenders (15%):** ₹100k-500k GMV/month
- **Medium spenders (35%):** ₹20k-100k GMV/month  
- **Low spenders (50%):** ₹2k-20k GMV/month

### Test Files Created
- `test_small_batch.xlsx` - 10 users (Quick testing)
- `test_medium_batch.xlsx` - 50 users (Integration testing)
- `test_large_batch.xlsx` - 200 users (Production simulation)
- `test_stress_test.xlsx` - 500 users (Stress testing)

All with corresponding JSON payloads for direct API testing.

## API Endpoints Tested

### ✅ POST /api/v1/recommendations
- **Status:** Working
- **Authentication:** Working (API key required)
- **Response:** Job queued successfully
- **Issue:** Slow processing for large batches

### ✅ GET /api/v1/status/{job_id}
- **Status:** Working
- **Real-time progress tracking:** Working
- **Issue:** Shows 0 progress until batch completes

### ✅ GET /api/v1/results/{job_id}
- **Status:** Working
- **Returns:** Complete recommendations for all users
- **Issue:** Only available after timeout for large batches

## Usage Examples for Data Team

### Quick Test (10 users)
```bash
python complete_api_test.py --batch-size 10
```
**Expected:** ~30 seconds, SUCCESS ✅

### Production Test (200 users)
```bash
python complete_api_test.py --batch-size 200
```
**Expected:** 5+ minutes, TIMEOUT ❌

### Using Test Data
```bash
# Test with pre-generated realistic data
python complete_api_test.py --batch-size 200
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Implement parallel processing (Option 1)
2. ✅ Test with 200 users again
3. ✅ Verify throughput meets requirements (100+ users/min)

### Short Term (This Month)
1. Add rate limiting to respect CardGenius API limits
2. Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
3. Add better error handling and retry logic
4. Monitor production usage patterns

### Long Term (Future)
1. Request batch API support from CardGenius
2. Implement caching for frequently requested users
3. Add analytics/monitoring dashboard
4. Consider scaling to multiple workers

---

## Conclusion

The API is **functional but not production-ready** for the data team's use case of processing 200+ user batches.

**Recommendation:** Implement parallel processing (Option 1) before announcing to data team.

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Expected Performance After Fix:** 200 users in < 30 seconds ✅
