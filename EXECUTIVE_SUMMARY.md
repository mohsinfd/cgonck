# Executive Summary: CardGenius API Performance Fix

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** 🔴 Production Blocker  
**Decision Required:** Approach selection

---

## The Problem (1 sentence)

Our API takes **5+ minutes** to process 200 users (needs to be < 2 minutes).

---

## Root Cause (1 sentence)

We call CardGenius API sequentially (one user at a time) instead of in parallel.

---

## Two Solutions Proposed by Tech Team

### Option 1: Parallel API Calls (Recommended First)
- **Speed:** 15 seconds for 200 users (20x faster)
- **Time to build:** 2-4 hours
- **Risk:** Low
- **Accuracy:** 100% (uses CardGenius)

### Option 2: Build Own Recommendation Engine
- **Speed:** 5 seconds for 200 users (60x faster)  
- **Time to build:** 2-3 weeks
- **Risk:** Medium (need to maintain card data)
- **Accuracy:** 95-99% (our own logic)

---

## Recommendation

**Do Option 1 now, evaluate Option 2 later.**

Why:
- ✅ Unblocks data team this week
- ✅ Low risk, proven approach
- ✅ Buys time to build Option 2 properly
- ✅ Can run both and compare

---

## Decision Needed

**Which approach should we implement first?**

- [ ] **Option 1** (Parallel processing) - Ready in 1 week
- [ ] **Option 2** (Server-side logic) - Ready in 3 weeks
- [ ] **Both** (Option 1 now, Option 2 later) - Recommended ✅

---

## Impact if We Do Nothing

- ❌ Data team cannot process daily batches
- ❌ Manual workarounds required
- ❌ Business operations impacted
- ❌ System won't scale beyond 50 users

---

## Next Steps (if approved)

**Week 1:**
1. Implement parallel processing
2. Test with 200+ users
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor performance

**Result:** Data team can process 200 users in < 2 minutes ✅
